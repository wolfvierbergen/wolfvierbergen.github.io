### Key Features

- Open-circuit design with 5.09:1 contraction ratio
- Maximum air speed of 33 km/h (9.2 m/s)
- Laminar flow generation capabilities
- Transparent test section for flow visualization
- Digital speed control system

## Technical Design

The wind tunnel consists of six main components. From left to right:

### 1. Honeycomb Flow Straightener
- 6600 plastic straws arranged in a grid
- 6mm diameter, 60mm length
- Mounted at tunnel inlet
- Reduces **lateral turbulence**

### 2. Flow Conditioning Screens
- Two screens with 64% open area
- Nylon mesh construction
- 45mm spacing between screens
- Reduces **axial turbulence**

### 3. Contraction Section
- 5.09:1 contraction ratio
- Fifth-order polynomial curve profile
- Optimized for minimal flow separation
- MDF construction with external skeleton

### 4. Test Section
- Dimensions: 180mm × 190mm × 580mm
- Plexiglass windows for visualization
- Bottom access port for force measurements

### 5. Diffuser
- 9.9° expansion angle
- 574mm length
- Gradual velocity reduction
- Pressure recovery section

### 6. Drive System
- 4 × 210W brushless motors
- Three-blade propellers
- Electronic speed controllers
- Servo tester for power control
- 7.4V LiPo battery power source

## Experimental Results

### Airfoil Testing
Conducted comprehensive testing using NACA 4412 airfoil:
- Lift coefficient measurements
- Angle of attack comparison
- Speed dependency analysis

Key findings:
1. Maximum lift achieved at 30° angle of attack
2. Experimental results closely matched theoretical predictions

## Technologies Used

- Fusion 360 for CAD design
- Laser cutting for precision components
- 3D printing for custom parts
- Pitot tube airspeed measurement
- Digital force measurement system

## Testing Methods

1. **Air Speed Measurement**
   - Pitot tube system
   - Fluid manometer measurement
   - Multiple test points across section
   - Speed range: 0-33 km/h

2. **Flow Quality Assessment**
   - Smoke visualization
   - Flow uniformity testing

3. **Force Measurement**
   - Digital scale
   - Multiple angle testing
